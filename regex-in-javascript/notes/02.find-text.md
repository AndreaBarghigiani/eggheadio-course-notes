**Starter string:** "Cat sat on the hat"
To find a pattern we just set the pattern in the regex you just need to write in a regex:
```js
const regex = /at/;
```
![Single matching regular expression](regex-in-javascript/images/02-single-match.jpg)

Now this regex will match the first exact *at* that we find in the string we are checking, if we want it to became global (means get as result **all** the matches), we can add the `g` flag:
```js
const regex = /at/g;
```

We can also use special metacharacter `.` to match any single character (letter, numbers or special) but will not match a line break.
```js
const regex = /.at/g;
```

As you can see with the `.` we will match also the single character does not matter what, for example if we change the string and make it start with *SuperCat* we will have this result:
![Use . gives us also a substring](regex-in-javascript/images/02-dot-substring.jpg)

Since dot will match any character excluding the line breaks we can try something different:
```js
const str = `Cat 
sat on 
the hat.`
```

And we will have different results based on how many dots we use in our regex:

![Using three dots to match any 3-char string](regex-in-javascript/images/02-three-dots-break-line.jpg)
![Using four dots to match any 4-char string](regex-in-javascript/images/02-four-dots-break-line.jpg)

Since the dot `.` is a metacharacter that we use in our regex if we need to include it in our pattern we need to escape it with the backslash `\`.
```js
const regex = /\./g;
```
